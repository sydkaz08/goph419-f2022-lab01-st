#This project was foucused on developing a solution that would approximate a gvien function.
#The approximate value was compared with the exact value to check the deviation between the two outputs.
#It was determined that the approximate solution developed using the Borwein and Chambarland method results in highly accurate output.
#The relationship between the launch angle and certain input parameters was visualized.
#Both alpha and ve_v0 are inversely related to the launch angle.
#The error in sin_phi was calculated and it turned out to be too high for the scope of this project. 
#That was because the error associated with the input parameters was too high.
#In future, error in the input parameters (alpha, ve_v0) can be reduced to optimize the results.
